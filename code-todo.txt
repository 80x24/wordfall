Begin Main Gameplay Development
=================================

I'm thinking that I'm not actually going to need the settings button, because
I can just get away with having a pause button, which will also bring up a
menu where you can access settings.

This is partially because I think that my settings picture is ugly, and
partially because I think it is redundant to have a settings and a pause
because pressing the settings will also pause the game.
