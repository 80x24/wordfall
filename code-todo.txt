Code Todo
=================
This document should theoretically only be for the collision branch so I
shouldn't have to worry about modifying my main code-todo.txt

## Collision Detection ##
# DONE #
See title-state.c for example collison detection.

## Highlighting Options with Mouse ##
#DONE#
May want to consider using less states.


## Highlight for Options with Keyboard ##
### May not be implemented due to issues of when to highlight when using a
keyboard. ###

This should theoretically be the same but I may have to make a state to
check for keyboard input, instead of mouse click. This is a lower priority
change because although it would be nice, and most games have it, you have
to use the mouse to play the game immediately after anyway, so it's not 
like it would be a problem to just click the options buttons.
