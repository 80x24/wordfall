Code Todo
=================
This document should theoretically only be for the collision branch so I
shouldn't have to worry about modifying my main code-todo.txt

##Collision Detection##
Basically implemented. Currently, the only checks for collision are on the
main title screen, but I can check for more late. set_next_state variables
have not been updated for any of the collision checks.

##Highlighting Options with Mouse##
This is going to be cumbersome because it looks like I am going to have
to create three new states. One state will be a static state, bascially
the title state, but after the letters have fallen down. Then I need to
create two more states, one for the highlighting of the play button and
another for the options button. There is a lot of repeated code here so
I should probably try to find a solution that doesn't involve me creating
a different state. I also really want to switch to oop and C++ because the
amount of states is getting ridiculous.

This feature is not completely crucial, but I think that it would look
really nice.

##Highlight for Options with Keyboard##
This should theoretically be the same but I may have to make a state to
check for keyboard input, instead of mouse click. This is a lower priority
change because although it would be nice, and most games have it, you have
to use the mouse to play the game immediately after anyway, so it's not 
like it would be a problem to just click the options buttons.
