The snap feature has been implemented.

Next feature that needs to be implemented is removing letters from the
containers. This is going to be somewhat challenging because the letters that
are in the containers are only copies of the letters that are falling so
introducing the letter into the falling mix by clicking and dragging would be
very difficult.

A very easy implementation would be to just have a right click(on pc) or a
double tap on touch screens remove the letter from the square. This is what I
am going to do because it actually makes more sense, and it is way easier to
implement for me.
