Some other fonts for consideration

----Futura----
The problem with Futura is that I don't know if it is proprietary, and I only have a weird apple font format on my computer right now.

----Ubuntu----
The Ubuntu font is always a possibility but it is a little too iconic.

----Junction----
Good, open source font. All I have to do is include the License. I just don't think it quite fits what the game is about right now.

---- News Cycle----
Another good open source font under the OFL. Still not amazing though.

---- Roboto and Droid Sans----
Roboto is always a choice because it is one of my favorite fonts. The fonts are Apache so were good, just redistribute the licenses.
